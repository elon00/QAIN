Here's the complete phase breakdown for building QAIN project from beginning to end:

Total Phases: 6
Phase 1: Project Setup and Smart Contracts (Solidity)

Goal: Establish the on-chain logic and smart contract infrastructure.
Deliverables: Hardhat project setup, QAINToken.sol, Rewarder.sol, ProofOfAI.sol, QuantumOracle.sol, and deployment scripts.
Status: COMPLETED (in our previous exchange)

Phase 2: Python Quantum Service

Goal: Develop the backend service for generating quantum randomness and potentially optimizing AI models.
Deliverables: Python scripts (qrng.py, optimizer.py), a Flask API (app.py) to expose these functionalities.
Focus: Qiskit integration, API development.

Phase 3: JavaScript Chainlink Adapter

Goal: Create the intermediary that connects the Python service to the blockchain via Chainlink oracles.
Deliverables: Node.js/JavaScript adapter code that calls the Python service and submits data to the QuantumOracle.sol and potentially ProofOfAI.sol contracts.
Focus: Chainlink Jobs, Oracle Automation, interacting with smart contracts.

Phase 4: React Frontend

Goal: Build the user interface for interacting with the deployed smart contracts and services.
Deliverables: React application using Vite, components for token display, reward claiming, AI proof submission, and viewing results.
Focus: React development, Web3 integration (ethers.js), connecting to smart contracts and potentially the Python API.

Phase 5: Integration and End-to-End Testing

Goal: Connect all the pieces and ensure they work together seamlessly.
Deliverables: Thorough testing of the entire flow: submitting an AI proof, the Chainlink adapter calling the Python service, the Python service returning data, the adapter submitting data to the contract, claiming rewards.
Focus: Unit testing, integration testing, debugging.

Phase 6: Deployment and Final Touches

Goal: Deploy the integrated application to a live network and finalize any remaining aspects.
Deliverables: Smart contracts deployed on a testnet (and potentially mainnet), frontend application hosted, final configuration checks.
Focus: Deployment procedures, user experience refinement, documentation.
